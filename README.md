## üìä Project Summary

- **Tool Used:** Power BI Desktop
- **Data Source:** COVID-19 dataset (state-wise and monthly case data)
- **Mode:** Import Mode
- **Focus:** State-wise & time-based analysis of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in India

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Performed using **Power Query Editor**:
- Removed duplicates and null values
- Changed data types (date, numeric)
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Created calculated columns (e.g., death rate, recovery rate)
- Extracted month from date column

---

## üß† DAX Measures

Created dynamic KPIs using DAX:
- `Total Cases = SUM(cases)`
- `Death Rate = DIVIDE(Total Deaths, Total Cases)`
- `Recovery Rate = DIVIDE(Total Recoveries, Total Cases)`
- Additional calculated columns for month and year

---

## üß© Data Modeling

- Defined relationships between tables (if multiple tables were used)
- Ensured proper cardinality and data integrity
- Created lookup tables for filters (e.g., State, Month)

---

## üìà Visualizations

Built an interactive one-page dashboard with the following elements:

- **KPI Cards:**
  - Total Cases
  - Total Recoveries
  - Death Rate
  - Recovery Rate

- **Pie Chart:**
  - Active Cases vs. Recoveries vs. Deaths

- **Map Visualization:**
  - Active cases by state (bubble size for volume)

- **Bar Chart:**
  - Top 5 states by total cases

- **Line Chart:**
  - Total deaths by month

- **Dropdown Filter:**
  - State selector for detailed filtering

- **Panel for New Deaths:**
  - Displays recently reported fatalities

---

## üöÄ Deployment

- Published to **Power BI Service**
- Configured **Scheduled Data Refresh**
- (Optional) Implemented **Role-Level Security (RLS)**
- Workspace hosted using **Power BI Premium**

---

## üìå Key Insights

- Delhi recorded the highest number of cases.
- The recovery rate reached 100% based on the dataset.
- Deaths spiked significantly from April onward.
- Active cases made up a small portion of total reported numbers.
